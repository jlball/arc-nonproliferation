Description: # arc-nonproliferation
        An OpenMC-based repo for studying proliferation issues in ARC-class fusion reactors.
        
        ## Installation and Setup
        This repo requires the latest development version of OpenMC (as of 12/24/22) and its depenencies. I am fairly confident that all of the OpenMC dependencies cover the required python packages needed for the rest of the code. To learn how to install OpenMC from source, visit the official website.
        
        The repo is built around a custom python package. After installing OpenMC from source, navigate to the repo directory and run:
        
        `pip install -e .`
        
        to install the custom API localy.
